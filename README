mksdiso 
Verison: 0.7

This toolkit creates a SDISO that is (sometimes) useable with the DreamShell ISO-Loader on the Dreamcast.
You can use Folders, CDIs and ISOs as Sources. 
It will create an useable (SD)ISO from it.


Installation:
	1. cp ./usr/local/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
	2. cp -r ./opt/mksdiso /opt/
	
	3. run mksdiso

Sources for all the binarys are also included!
Thanks to the creaters of these tools :)
