	IP.BIN/BOOT.BIN SB Hacker - 32bit BINHACK Clone - FamilyGuy 2011 - 2014

	This is my attemp at creating a clone of binhack.exe in a 32-bit executable
	format to be compatible with non-16bit operating system (aka 64bit Win7).
	The Goal is to make it a *clone* so it can be used the same way as the
	original, just rename it BINHACK.EXE and it should works with old batch
	files. It'll also enable the VGA flag in the ip.bin, as there's no good
	reason not to do so. 
	
	A big thank you goes to SiZiOUS for optimizing and cleaning my source code!

				    --- New in 1.0.0.2 ---
	If it detects a wince file that has been processed by
	bincon.exe, it'll set the OS flag to 0 in ip.bin, so no need to do it 
	manually as with original binhack. This also fix a bug in 1.0.0.1 where 
	bincon'd bins where actually hacked when they should not have been.

				    --- New in 1.0.0.3 ---
	Some improvements to the makefile for Linux compiling, "make linux" compiles
	binhack32 under linux and compress it with upx as it should. 
	Made both a bat and a bash test script.
	Source-Code released under WTF Public License v2.

        Makefile edited for compatibility with Mac OS X. Thanks to darcagn.
        Compile by executing "make osx".
